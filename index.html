                <p>
                    At <span>Vesperium</span>, we are committed to ensuring that all visitors
                    have an enjoyable and accessible experience. We have designed our spaces
                    with accessibility in mind to accommodate individuals with varying
                    abilities. Our museum offers wheelchair accessibility throughout the
                    building, including ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. We
                    also provide free wheelchairs at the Guest Services desk for those who
                    may need them during their visit. If you need any assistance or have
                    specific requirements, please do not hesitate to ask our staff, who are
                    happy to assist you.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                </p>

                <p>
                    We offer a range of services for visitors with sensory impairments to enhance
                    their experience. Our museum provides hearing loops in several of our exhibition
                    spaces, allowing visitors who are hard of hearing to better engage with audio content.
                    Additionally, many of our exhibits offer tactile elements, touchable displays, and
                    descriptive signage in large print and Braille for blind or low-vision guests. For
                    visitors on the autism spectrum, we provide sensory-friendly tools, such as noise-canceling
                    headphones, fidget toys, and quiet areas to help reduce overwhelming stimuli.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    We are also proud to offer digital accessibility features on our website, including
                    screen reader compatibility and alternative text for images. Our virtual tours and
                    educational content are available with closed captioning, making them accessible to a
                    wider audience. We encourage visitors to reach out with any specific needs or suggestions
                    for improvement so we can continue to create an inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone.
                    Thank you for visiting <span>Vesperium</span>, where accessibility is a priority for all.
