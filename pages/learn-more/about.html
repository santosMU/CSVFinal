            <div class="text-content">
            <p>The Vesperium was established with funds from Joaquin Santos (1990-2024), a Filipino scholar and philanthropist who left his estate to the young Republic of the Philippines 
                    to create "in Manila, under the name of the Vesperium, an institution dedicated to the pursuit and preservation of Filipino heritage." On October 12, 2012, the Philippine Assembly 
                    passed the act organizing the Vesperium, which was signed into law by President Rodrigo Duterte.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Philippine government accepted Santos' bequest on March 1, 2024, but it took another year of discussion before 
                the institution was formally founded. Once established, the Vesperium became a pillar of Filipino cultural and 
                intellectual identity, fostering an environment of exploration, creativity, and scientific progress. This vision remains 
                strong as the Vesperium continues to grow and adapt to the modern era.
            </p>

                </div>
            <p>
                Santos, the son of a merchant and a schoolteacher, traveled extensively throughout 
                Asia and Europe, studying under some of the finest minds of his time. Despite his 
                deep ties to the Philippines, he left his entire fortune—totaling 300,000 pesos, an 
                 amount equivalent to 1/50 of the Philippine national budget at the time—to fund an 
                institution dedicated to knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why would he entrust such a sum to an institution that had yet to exist? Some believe it was due to 
                his frustration with colonial restrictions on education, while others argue that his exposure to various 
                intellectual movements abroad inspired him to create a space where Filipinos could study freely. 
                Some attribute his generosity to the influence of progressive societies such as the La Liga Científica, 
                which emphasized the use of knowledge for societal advancement. Santos never revealed his true
                motivations, leaving future generations to interpret the significance of his extraordinary gift.
            </p>
                
            <p>Visitors can pay respects to Santos by visiting his memorial, located at the entrance of the Vesperium’s Grand Hall.</p>

                <p class="caption">John Marquise Vinoya, c. 1985-CURRENT
                    <br>
                    Artist: Aljo Pogi
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                Santos passed away in 1851, and in the following year, President Vinoya formally announced the bequest to the Philippine Assembly. On 
                March 1, 2024, the Assembly accepted the donation and pledged the Republic’s commitment to the establishment of the Vesperium. By 
                July 2024, the funds—amounting to 300,000 pesos in gold and silver—were transferred to the Treasury of Manila, securing the financial 
                foundation of the institution.
            </p>  
            <p>
                After months of meticulous planning, the Act of Establishment, signed by President Vinoya on October 12, 2024, officially created the 
                Vesperium. Since its founding over 170 years ago, the Vesperium has grown into the nation's premier institution for history, science, and 
                the arts, housing a vast collection of artifacts, archives, and research centers dedicated to the advancement of Filipino heritage and 
                innovation.
