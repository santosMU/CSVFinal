            <br>

            <p>
                At <span>Vesperium</span>, we are committed to ensuring that all visitors 
                have an enjoyable and accessible experience. We have designed our spaces 
                with accessibility in mind to accommodate individuals with varying 
                abilities. Our museum offers wheelchair accessibility throughout the 
                building, including ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. We 
                also provide free wheelchairs at the Guest Services desk for those who 
                may need them during their visit. If you need any assistance or have 
                specific requirements, please do not hesitate to ask our staff, who are 
                happy to assist you.

                <br>
                <br>

            </p>

            <p>
                We offer a range of services for visitors with sensory impairments to enhance 
                their experience. Our museum provides hearing loops in several of our exhibition 
                spaces, allowing visitors who are hard of hearing to better engage with audio content. 
                Additionally, many of our exhibits offer tactile elements, touchable displays, and 
                descriptive signage in large print and Braille for blind or low-vision guests. For 
                visitors on the autism spectrum, we provide sensory-friendly tools, such as noise-canceling 
                headphones, fidget toys, and quiet areas to help reduce overwhelming stimuli.

            <p>
                We are also proud to offer digital accessibility features on our website, including 
                screen reader compatibility and alternative text for images. Our virtual tours and 
                educational content are available with closed captioning, making them accessible to a 
                wider audience. We encourage visitors to reach out with any specific needs or suggestions 
                for improvement so we can continue to create an inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone. 
                Thank you for visiting <span>Vesperium</span>, where accessibility is a priority for all.
